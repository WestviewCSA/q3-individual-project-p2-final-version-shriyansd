What question(s) did you generate that can be better (get to real answers or understanding) by rewording them to be open-ended or closed? 
I think I can use more project specific terms in my questions that help narrow down what I am asking. 
This provides for more knowledge to work with and a better understanding. By rewording one-word answer questions to be opn-ended, I can also get more information.
